Clean and explore
Income train (income_train.csv) is presented in Spanish. 
1 Rename the columns into their English translation (to_en.py). 
2 Dataframe is returned to undummy condition (undummy_df.py). 
3 Several features are dropped due to too many nans, and to much variability (rent_payment, years_behind_school, id). 
4 The dataframe contains categorical, continous and discrete data. The Target is a discrete variabe between 1 and 4.
5 Num_tablets has many nan, however they exist where there are no tablets. Thus set nan to zeros. Also, exploration uncovered empty strings not showing as nan.
6 There is a strong bias to Target level 4.
7 Some positive and some negative correlation to the target is observed with the quantitative data.

8 Households with no head (15) are dropped from the dataset.
9 Poverty level is set for all members of a household to the household heads level.
10 Missing mean education level is set to the mean education level.
11 Locate empty education levels and replace with mean education level for given age.
11a Manually fill the 3 missing education levels.
12 Fill missing roof_material with mode of roof_material (66).
13 Fill missing elec_provider with mode of elec_provider (15).
14 Drop repetitive data, and data that doesnt help model (determined experimentally).
15 Calculate new dependency (dependents/total occupants).
16 Encode conditions (roof, floor, wall). Create overall condition, and drop individual conditions.
17 Get dummy variables.

Model
1 Verify no null values. 
2 Drop duplicates.
3 Test train split (20%).
4 Fit PCA, 7 components determined experimentally.
5 Drop pca build features, concatenate new features.
6 Fit Random Forest Model. Accuracy score is relatively high.
7 Print confusion matrix visual.
8 Cross validation shows some overfitting.
